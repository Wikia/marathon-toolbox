### Project properties that change behaviour

- marathon.forceUpdate - makes app update override any deployments currently running
- marathon.preserveInstanceAllocation - makes app update preserve the configuration of number of instances


### TODO:
- Consul as a source of configuration instead of GitHub file
- On runtime check if user is running latest version of plugin. Its pretty important to watch this
